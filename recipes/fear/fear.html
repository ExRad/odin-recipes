<h2>The above photo is the end result of our second recipe. Looks at bit frightning doesn't it?</h2>
<h2>Want to try it? Seems a bit of a strange thing to do. Check out below for the ingredients.</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A tablespoon of realisation that you might be stuck in this life forever</li>
    <li>A family that depends on you for the career you currently have</li>
    <li>A desire to have a homestead in Wales</li>
    <li>A desire to have a job that you can do from home</li>
    <li>Half a tablespoon of realisation that this is probably not possible</li>
</ul>

<h2>In order to get it just right, follow the steps below.</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Put the first realisation in a cup, then take it out and put it in the bin</li>
    <li>Remember that your current job, although it burns you out and makes you miserable, it allows you to provide for your family and has stability</li>
    <li>Suddenly start thinking about how you can have a homestead in Wales and raise a family</li>
    <li>Three teaspoons of knowing that a remote job is the only way I'll be able to have a homestead</li>
    <li>Realise how hard all of this will be to achieve</li>
</ol>

<h2>If you followed all the steps exactly, you will have a nice, filling pile of fear (on a plate). Congratulations, enjoy!</h2>
