<h2>The above photo is the end result of our first recipe. Looks dreary doesn't it?</h2>
<h2>Want to try it? Why would you want to? Check out below for the ingredients.</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A tablespoon of student debt (more like a jug full but stick to the tablespoon for now)</li>
    <li>Three years of a degree that ultimately ended up giving you a career that you do not enjoy</li>
    <li>A post graduate degree salary below 25k</li>
    <li>A terrible work-life balance</li>
    <li>Half a tablespoon of being burnt out</li>
</ul>

<h2>In order to get it just right, follow the steps below.</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Undertake any degree</li>
    <li>Be given false assurances during said degree that turn out to be exaggerations</li>
    <li>Do a degree in a allied health profession</li>
    <li>Work hours that do not allow any flexibility at all for family commitments</li>
    <li>Work in a busy trauma hospital during the pandemic and work more than four 12 hour shifts in a standard working week</li>
    <li>Repeat previous step across multiple months because of staff shortages and sickness</li>
</ol>

<h2>If you followed all the steps exactly, you will have a hot, steaming pile of regret (probably in a bowl). Congratulations, enjoy!</h2>
