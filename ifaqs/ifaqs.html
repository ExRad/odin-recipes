<h2>I'm surprised you clicked on this page. I would've tuned out after the recipes.</h2>
<h2>Below you will see some questions that have only been asked once and will only be answered once. So not really infrequent.</h2>

<h3>Question 1: If the questions have only been answered once, isn't infrequent the wrong word to use?</h3>
<h3>Answer 1: No.</h3>

<h3>Question 2: This is a recipe page, why isn't there any food?</h3>
<h3>Answer 2: On The Odin Project's recipe page, it mentions lasagne once, food 0 times. Not very convincing to follow the traditional format.</h3>

<h3>Question 3: Why haven't I followed the traditional format?</h3>
<h3>Answer 3: This is my first website with html, so I wanted it to be something personal that I could refer back to. Something to improve too.</h3>

<h3>Question 4: Why is..</h3>
<h3>Answer 4: No more questions.</h3>
