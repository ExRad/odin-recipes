<h2>This website has recipes, which don't really provide any nutritional value. So, if you're here for that, you are going to be disappointed.</h2>

<p>With that being said, there are some rules for perusing (which is a real word, I looked it up) this website.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Digest these recipes in the order that they appear on the screen. As in, 1-4 not mouth to anus.</li>
    <li>Don't expect detailed recipes, I'm making it up as I go.</li>
    <li>When you're finished with all the recipes, check out the unfrequently answered questions page, it'll clear things up.</li>
    <li>Overall, enjoy.</li>
</ol>
